To provide a complete project with setup instructions, detailed API documentation, and design decisions and assumptions, hereâ€™s a structured approach to creating those documents:

### 1. **Setup Instructions**

#### Backend Setup (Node.js and Hasura)

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Snehal714/Fintech-plateform.git
   
   ```

2. **Install Node.js Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory with the following content:
     ```env
     PORT=3000
     HASURA_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql
     HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET=your-secret-key
     ```

4. **Run the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Hasura Setup**
   - **Start Hasura Console**:
     ```bash
     hasura console
     ```
   - **Apply Migrations** (if any):
     ```bash
     hasura migrate apply
     ```
   - **Verify** that your tables and permissions are set up correctly.

6. **Database Setup** (PostgreSQL)
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Set up your database schema using Hasura.

#### Frontend Setup (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

1. **Navigate to Frontend Directory**
   - If your frontend is in a separate directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

2. **Open in Browser**
   - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the frontend.

### 2. **Detailed API Documentation**

#### **1. Deposit Endpoint**

- **URL**: `/deposit`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Adds a specified amount to the user's account balance.

- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "amount": 100
  }
  ```

- **Response**:
  - **Success**:
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "data": {
        "id": 1,
        "balance": 500
      }
    }
    ```
  - **Failure**:
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": "Error message"
    }
    ```

#### **2. Withdraw Endpoint**

- **URL**: `/withdraw`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Deducts a specified amount from the user's account balance.

- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "amount": 50
  }
  ```

- **Response**:
  - **Success**:
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "data": {
        "id": 1,
        "balance": 450
      }
    }
    ```
  - **Failure**:
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": "Error message"
    }
    ```

#### **3. Error Handling**

- **404 Not Found**: If an invalid endpoint is accessed.
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": "Resource not found"
  }
  ```

- **500 Internal Server Error**: For unexpected server errors.
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": "Internal server error"
  }
  ```

### 3. **Design Decisions and Assumptions**

#### **Design Decisions:**

1. **Architecture**:
   - The platform is built using a microservices architecture, separating backend logic (Node.js) from the data layer (Hasura/PostgreSQL) and frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).

2. **Database**:
   - PostgreSQL is used as the relational database, with Hasura providing a GraphQL interface for flexible data querying.

3. **API**:
   - GraphQL APIs are used for database interaction, offering a more flexible approach compared to REST.

4. **Security**:
   - Implemented basic security using Hasura Admin Secret.
   - Future iterations should consider adding JWT authentication and role-based access control.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Basic error handling is in place, with structured error responses for easier debugging and client-side handling.

6. **Frontend**:
   - The frontend is kept simple to focus on core functionalities like deposit, withdrawal, and displaying balances.

**Assumptions:**

1. **User Authentication**:
   - The current iteration does not include user authentication. It is assumed that this would be handled externally or added in future development.

2. **Currency Handling**:
   - All financial transactions are assumed to be in a single currency for simplicity.

3. **Scalability**:
   - While the platform is designed with scalability in mind (microservices, GraphQL), actual scaling (e.g., load balancing, database sharding) would require further development.

4. **User Interface**:
   - The UI is minimalistic and assumes users are comfortable with basic web interfaces.
